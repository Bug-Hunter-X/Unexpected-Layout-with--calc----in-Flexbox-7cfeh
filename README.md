# Unexpected Layout with `calc()` in Flexbox

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS, specifically within flexbox layouts. The `bug.css` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.

The problem stems from how flexbox calculates sizes and how `calc()` interacts with those calculations.  The solution focuses on understanding the flexbox context and adjusting `calc()` to achieve the desired outcome.  Please review both files for a complete understanding.
