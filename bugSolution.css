  /* Corrected usage of calc() */
  min-width: calc(50% - 10px);

/*The previous implementation was incorrect, as it tried to subtract 10px from the flexible 100%, which is incorrect. Flexbox calculates the space available and then divides it based on the flex-grow property. Thus, this is handled differently than block level layout.*/
